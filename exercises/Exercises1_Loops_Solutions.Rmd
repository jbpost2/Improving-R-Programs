# For Loop Creation

1) Create a for loop iterating from 1 to 26 that prints the statement "* is the n-th letter of the alphabet." in each iteration. Use the built-in 'letters' vector to get the letters and use the `scales::ordinal` function to create a vector of the numbers with suffixes. Then combine all the strings together with the `paste` function, and put the whole thing inside a `print` statement.

```{r}
suffix <- scales::ordinal(1:26)

for(l in 1:26){
  print(paste(letters[l], "is the", suffix[l] ,"letter of the alphabet."))
}
```
