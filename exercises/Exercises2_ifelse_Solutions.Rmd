FizzBuzz is a common programming problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz> used to practice if statements and division. 

For our version, create a vector `test_vec` of the numbers 1 to 50 (`1:50`). Then apply the following rules using `dplyr::if_else` statements to obtain the appropriate behavior:

- if the number is divisible by 3, output "Fizz"
- if the number is divisible by 5, output "Buzz"
- if the number is divisible by 15, output "FizzBuzz"
- otherwise, return the number as a character (`as.character()`)

Notes:  
- `%%` will give the remainder or a division (for instance `15 %% 3` is `r 15 %% 3` and `16 %% 3` is `r 16 %% 3`).  You can use this function and check if the remainder is 0.  
- You have to start with checking 15 and then you can do 5 or 3 after that.  

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
test_vec <- 1:50
library(dplyr)
if_else(test_vec %% 15 == 0, "FizzBuzz", 
       if_else(test_vec %% 3 == 0, "Fizz", 
              if_else(test_vec %% 5 ==0, "Buzz", as.character(test_vec))
              )
      )
```
