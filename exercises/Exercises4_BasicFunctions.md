Exercises 4 - Basic Functions
================

1.  Write your own absolute value function called `myAbsoluteValue.`
    There are two options for what to do with the input:  

-   If x is positive or zero, return x.
-   If x is negative, return -x.

Allow the function to take in an entire vector of values by using
`if_else()` to do your comparison.

2.  Check your function works by plugging in the values below.

``` r
3
-5
c(3, -5)
-10:10
```
